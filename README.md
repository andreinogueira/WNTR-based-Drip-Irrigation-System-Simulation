# WNTR-based-Drip-Irrigation-System-Simulation

A real example of drip irrigation system is simulated on WNTR python package. This simulation were created to obtain the pressure and flow data of the pipes 
in the irrigation system water pipe network. Through this, a data-driven leakage detection, localization and classification system were created using machine learning models.
